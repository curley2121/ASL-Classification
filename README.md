# ASL Classification
This is a group project that I helped complete for my Machine Learning Course. We constructed an American Sign Language image classifier using a convolutional neural network. I was personnally responsible for the neural network model architecture and regularization. We were able to achieve a generalization accuracy of 97% for classifying various images of American Sign Language correctly. Independently, I learned how to effectivley test and implement various regularization methods in keras as well as construct the optimal model architecture and increase accuracy signifigantly.
